# Peter Thiel
- If I could go back 20 or 25 years, **I wish I would have known that there was no need to wait**...So if you're planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10-year plan of how to get there, you should ask: **Why can't I do this in 6 months?** Sometimes, you have to actually go through the complex 10-year trajectory. But it's at least worth asking **whether that's the story you're telling yourself, or whether that's the reality.**
- **Failure is always simply a tragedy**
- I think trends are often things to avoid. What I prefer over trend is a sense of mission. That you are working on a unique problem that people are not solving elsewhere. 
- Ask questions:
  - Is this true?
  - Why am I doing this?
  - Tell me something that's true that very few people agree with you on
  - What problem do you face everyday that nobody has solved yet?
  - What is a great company no one has started?
