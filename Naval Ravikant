- Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts (Eckhart Tolle)
- Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. So, I like to stay aware of that because then I can choose my desire carefully. I try not to have more than one big desire in my life at any given time, and I also recognize that as the axis of my suffering. I realize that that's where I've chosen to be unhappy.
- Mathematics is the language of nature
- There are entire civilizations that we remember now with just one or two words like "Sumerian" or "Mayan" Do you know any Sumerians or Mayans? Do you hold any of them in high regard of esteem? Have they outlived their natural lifespan somehow? No. If you don't believe in an afterlife, then you should realize that this is such a short and precious life, and it is really important that you don't spend it being unhappy. There is no excuse for spending most of your life in misery.
