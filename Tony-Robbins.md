# Tony Robbins
- If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy (Jim Rohn)
- The quality of your life is the quality of your questions
- **State --> Story --> Strategy** (prime your state first. The biochemistry will help you tell an enabling story, from which you can create powerful strategies)
- **Asymmetrical risks and rewards:** All successful people look for the least amount of risk to get the max amount of upside. They don't believe they have to take huge risks for huge rewards.
