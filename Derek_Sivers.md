- How to thrive in an unknowable future? **Choose the plan with the most options.** The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans.
- For people starting out - say "yes" to everything. Every little gig. You just never know what are the lottery tickets.
- The standard pace is for chumps (e.g. School has to organize its curricula around the lowest common denominator, so that almost no one is left out)
- **"Busy" = out of control.** When people say I must be incredibly busy, I always think, "No, I'm not." Because I'm in control of my time. I'm on top of it. "Busy" to me seems to imply "out of control." (Lack of time = lack of priorities)
- **You shouldn't start a business unless people are asking you to.**
- **We are whatever we pretend to be** (Kurt Vonnegut)
