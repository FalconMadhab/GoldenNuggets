## GOLDEN NUGGETS
**This is a repository of "golden nuggets" or pieces of wisdom I learned from others.**

# Arnold Schwarzenegger
- My confidence came from my vision...I am a big believer that if you have a very clear vision of where you want to go, then the rest of it is much easier.

# Derek Sivers
- How to thrive in an unknowable future? **Choose the plan with the most options.** The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans.
- For people starting out - say "yes" to everything. Every little gig. You just never know what are the lottery tickets.
- The standard pace is for chumps (e.g. School has to organize its curricula around the lowest common denominator, so that almost no one is left out)
- **"Busy" = out of control.** When people say I must be incredibly busy, I always think, "No, I'm not." Because I'm in control of my time. I'm on top of it. "Busy" to me seems to imply "out of control." (Lack of time = lack of priorities)
- **You shouldn't start a business unless people are asking you to.**
- **We are whatever we pretend to be** (Kurt Vonnegut) 

# Marc Andreesen
- Be so good they can't ignore you (Steve Martin)

# Naval Ravikant
- Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts (Eckhart Tolle)
- **Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want**. So, I like to stay aware of that because then I can choose my desire carefully. I try not to have more than one big desire in my life at any given time, and I also recognize that as the axis of my suffering. I realize that that's where I've chosen to be unhappy.
- Mathematics is the language of nature
- There are entire civilizations that we remember now with just one or two words like "Sumerian" or "Mayan" Do you know any Sumerians or Mayans? Do you hold any of them in high regard of esteem? Have they outlived their natural lifespan somehow? No. If you don't believe in an afterlife, then you should realize that this is such a short and precious life, and it is really important that you don't spend it being unhappy. There is no excuse for spending most of your life in misery.

# Tony Robbins
- If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy (Jim Rohn)
- The quality of your life is the quality of your questions
- **State --> Story --> Strategy** (prime your state first. The biochemistry will help you tell an enabling story, from which you can create powerful strategies)
- **Asymmetrical risks and rewards:** All successful people look for the least amount of risk to get the max amount of upside. They don't believe they have to take huge risks for huge rewards.

# Casey Neistat
- The ultimate quantification of success is not how much you spend doing what you love. It's how little time you spend doing what you hate.

# Steve Jobs
> Coming back to America was, for me, much more of a cultural shock than going to India. The people in the Indian countryside don’t use their intellect like we do, they use their intuition instead, and their intuition is far more developed than in the rest of the world. **Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect, in my opinion.** <br><br> Western rational thought is not an innate human characteristic; it is learned and is the great achievement of Western civilization. In the villages of India, they never learned it. They learned something else, which is in some ways just as valuable but in other ways is not. That’s the power of intuition and experiential wisdom. <br><br> Coming back after seven months in Indian villages, I saw the craziness of the Western world as well as its capacity for rational thought. If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things—that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It’s a discipline; you have to practice it. <br><br> Zen has been a deep influence in my life ever since...I learned the truth of the Zen saying that if you are willing to travel around the world to meet a teacher, one will appear next door.


# Reid Hoffman 
- **Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious** (Thomas Edison)
- Reid gives his subconscious a problem to work on in his sleep. "I actually think most of our thinking, of course, is subconscious. Part of what I'm trying to do is allow the fact that we have this kind of relaxation, rejuvenation period in sleeping, to essentially bubble eup the thoughts and solutions to it." <br><br> Ideally, Reid budgets 60 minutes for the following: "The very first thing I do when I get up, almost always, is to sit down and work on that problem [I've set the day before] because that's when I'm freshest. I'm not distracted by phone calls and responses to things, and so forth. It's the most tabula rasa - blank slate - moment that I have. I use that to maximize my creativity on a particular project.
