## GOLDEN NUGGETS
**This is a repository of "golden nuggets" or pieces of wisdom I learned from others.**

# Arnold Schwarzenegger
- My confidence came from my vision...I am a big believer that if you have a very clear vision of where you want to go, then the rest of it is much easier.

# Derek Sivers
- How to thrive in an unknowable future? **Choose the plan with the most options.** The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans.
- For people starting out - say "yes" to everything. Every little gig. You just never know what are the lottery tickets.
- The standard pace is for chumps (e.g. School has to organize its curricula around the lowest common denominator, so that almost no one is left out)
- **"Busy" = out of control.** When people say I must be incredibly busy, I always think, "No, I'm not." Because I'm in control of my time. I'm on top of it. "Busy" to me seems to imply "out of control." (Lack of time = lack of priorities)
- **You shouldn't start a business unless people are asking you to.**
- **We are whatever we pretend to be** (Kurt Vonnegut) 

# Marc Andreesen
- Be so good they can't ignore you (Steve Martin)

# Naval Ravikant
- Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts (Eckhart Tolle)
- **Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want**. So, I like to stay aware of that because then I can choose my desire carefully. I try not to have more than one big desire in my life at any given time, and I also recognize that as the axis of my suffering. I realize that that's where I've chosen to be unhappy.
- Mathematics is the language of nature
- There are entire civilizations that we remember now with just one or two words like "Sumerian" or "Mayan" Do you know any Sumerians or Mayans? Do you hold any of them in high regard of esteem? Have they outlived their natural lifespan somehow? No. If you don't believe in an afterlife, then you should realize that this is such a short and precious life, and it is really important that you don't spend it being unhappy. There is no excuse for spending most of your life in misery.
