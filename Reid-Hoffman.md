# Reid Hoffman 
- **Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious** (Thomas Edison)
- Reid gives his subconscious a problem to work on in his sleep. "I actually think most of our thinking, of course, is subconscious. Part of what I'm trying to do is allow the fact that we have this kind of relaxation, rejuvenation period in sleeping, to essentially bubble eup the thoughts and solutions to it." <br><br> Ideally, Reid budgets 60 minutes for the following: "The very first thing I do when I get up, almost always, is to sit down and work on that problem [I've set the day before] because that's when I'm freshest. I'm not distracted by phone calls and responses to things, and so forth. It's the most tabula rasa - blank slate - moment that I have. I use that to maximize my creativity on a particular project.
